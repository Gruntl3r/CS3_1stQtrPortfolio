# 1. List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.

### Basic statements of Javascript - I had a relativeley easy time understanding the concept of the I/O statements because I had advanced studied before the school year started. I also just naturally find coding interesting and easy to learn.

### if else - I found this topic the most interesting and fun because it added a lot of depth to coding as well as allowing me to have fun with the conditions and executions. It was also the easiest lesson in c++.

### while loops - this was the easiest loop I learned to do because it was the most used in c++ and was the simplest one. I also had more trouble learning for and do while loops because there were more complicated structures to it.

### Declaring functions - I had a relativeley easy time memorizing the format. I also found the concept pretty cool due to being a block of code within a line of code.

### How to use Github - I found it easy to learn the layout, how to clone and how to commit code on github. It was also fun to use it because unlike codeblocks it was interesting and not "old".

# 2. List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed. 

### syntax - A few times I forgot the proper syntax for code and that lead to me knowing what to do but confused on how to code it in. It was mostly just a problem of me memorizing the actual format.

### Calling functions - This again was a problem with syntax but it was really just the entire keyword that I was missing.

### do while loops - I had a problem in this mostly because it was confusing me in the sense that it was similar to a while loop but the code was executed before the condition.

### for loops - I was always a bit confused with how these loops worked because I didn't understand why we needed to do stuff like (i=0,i<10;i++>) so I never had a good foundation for next lessons.

### debugging - I had a bit of trouble in debugging as well due to my lack of knowledge in correct syntax.

# 3. Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

### syntax - To fix my problem in syntax I guess I can just learn to memorize the format or code in practice so I can get used to it more.

### calling functions - Similar to syntax I can just memorize the format and correct keyword.

### do while loops - I can try to understand more of how the loop works instead of how the correct syntax is and used.

### for loops - Unlike do while loops it would be better if I just learned the formula because recently I started understanding already how it worked.

### debugging - I guess I can just start practicing debugging normally so I can also get used to how normal and abnormal syntax looks like.

# 4. In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

## Helpful
1. Demonstrations - I found it really cool to be able to use the code while ma'am aline was teaching and watching the code work in real time. It helped me a lot since im more of a visual learner as well.
2. Graded excercises - It was fun to try and beat my deskmates in a race to get the correct code and it also was basically practice for the correct syntax and format.

## Not Helpful
1. Explanations - Like I said im a visual learner so hearing ma'am aline explain what the code was was really not helpful to me at all.
2. Excercises without demo code shown - When I mean this I mean having us do a coding excercise without a demo or correct format shown to us becuse if for example a student doesnt know the correct format or cant get it right, they won't be able to answer the excercise so as the class continues they will be delayeda bit.
